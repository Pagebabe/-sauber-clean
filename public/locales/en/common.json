    "buying1Question": "Can foreigners buy property in Thailand?",
    "buying1Answer": "Yes, foreigners can buy condominiums in Thailand with full freehold ownership, as long as the foreign ownership quota in the building does not exceed 49%. Foreigners cannot directly own land, but can lease it for up to 30 years (renewable) or set up a Thai company to purchase land.",
    "buying2Question": "What are the costs involved in buying property?",
    "buying2Answer": "Transfer fees are typically 2% of the property value (often split 50/50 between buyer and seller). Additional costs may include stamp duty (0.5%), withholding tax, specific business tax, and legal fees. Budget approximately 3-5% of the purchase price for all fees.",
    "buying3Question": "How long does it take to complete a property purchase?",
    "buying3Answer": "The process typically takes 4-8 weeks from offer acceptance to completion. This includes contract preparation, due diligence, mortgage approval (if applicable), and transfer at the Land Office.",
    "renting1Question": "What documents do I need to rent a property?",
    "renting1Answer": "You typically need a valid passport, visa (if applicable), proof of income or employment, and a deposit. Some landlords may also request references or a guarantor.",
    "renting2Question": "How much deposit is required for renting?",
    "renting2Answer": "The standard deposit is usually 2 months rent, plus 1 month advance rent. This may vary depending on the property and landlord. Deposits are refundable at the end of the lease, minus any damages or unpaid bills.",
    "legal1Question": "What is a usufruct and how does it work?",
    "legal1Answer": "A usufruct is a legal right that allows a foreigner to use and benefit from a property (including land) for up to 30 years, renewable. It can be registered at the Land Office and provides strong legal protection.",
    "legal2Question": "Can I get a visa based on property ownership?",
    "legal2Answer": "No, property ownership alone does not grant a visa. However, property owners can apply for other visa categories like retirement visa, business visa, or Thai Elite visa. Consult with immigration authorities for specific requirements.",
    "investment1Question": "What is the average ROI for rental properties in Pattaya?",
    "investment1Answer": "Rental yields in Pattaya typically range from 5-8% per year, depending on location, property type, and management. Popular tourist areas near the beach tend to offer higher yields.",
    "investment2Question": "Are property prices increasing in Pattaya?",
    "investment2Answer": "Pattaya property prices have shown steady growth over the past decade, averaging 3-5% per year. Prime beachfront locations and new developments tend to appreciate faster. Market conditions vary by area and property type.",
    "general1Question": "What are the best areas to live in Pattaya?",
    "general1Answer": "Popular areas include Wongamat Beach (quiet, upscale), Jomtien (family-friendly), Na Jomtien (peaceful), Pratumnak Hill (sea views), and Central Pattaya (convenient). The best area depends on your lifestyle preferences and budget.",
    "general2Question": "What utilities and maintenance costs should I expect?",
    "general2Answer": "Monthly costs typically include: electricity (฿1,500-3,000), water (฿150-300), internet (฿500-1,000), and condominium fees (฿30-80 per sqm). Costs vary based on usage and property size.",
    "general3Question": "Is it safe to invest in Thai real estate?",
    "general3Answer": "Yes, with proper due diligence and legal advice. Always use a reputable lawyer, verify ownership documents, check for encumbrances, and ensure the property has all necessary permits and approvals.",
